# FIRST_ML_Project-Titanic_Competition

I recently finished the Machine Learning course by Stanford University and professor Andrew Ng. I am doing this as a capstone project for myself, with the purpose of trying to apply and seal some of the knowledge I got from it. I highly recommend it to everyone new to ML.

Also, the course was in MATLab/Octave so I will be using this to help me get used to Python.

If there's any ideas or suggestions for improving the model, please let me know! I'm all about learning new stuff and improving my notebooks.
